The very every first class for any scripting is variables.

what is Variables?

Variables is a temporary stores for  a piece of information. In variables we can perform 2 actions.

1) Assigning the Variables value.
2) Accessing or reading the variable value.

Example:

For assigning the variables, use = symbols.
For reading and accessing the variables, use $ symbols.

Sytnex: Assigning the varaibles.
                        Variable_name=Variable_value
                     eg: Name="sharath" [NOTE: when we use value as STRING in bash scripting use ("") double quotes or ('') single quotes]

Syntex: Reading/Accessing the variables value.
                        $variable_name [It will extract the value of variable]
                      eg:echo $Name
                       output: Sharath
